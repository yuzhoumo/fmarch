## Cloning

External dependencies are included as git submodules in `lib`. Clone source
files and dependencies using:

```
git clone git@github.com:yuzhoumo/fmarch.git --recursive
```

Note: If using NixOS, there is no need for the `--recursive` flag since
dependencies are pulled from nix-store.

## Building with CMake

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Building with Nix

On NixOS, you can build by running `nix-build` in the main project directory
or entering the build environment using `nix-shell` and following the CMake
build instructions. When building using `nix-build`, the resulting binary can
be run with `./result/bin/fmarch` in the same directory.

## Usage

```
./fmarch vertex_shader_path fragment_shader_path
```
